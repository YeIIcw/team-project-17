# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Which platform will you use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project? (Examples: Text message, Discord, WeChat, etc.)
    We will be communicating in a groupchat on Instagram.

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time? 
    - For urgent messages (deadlines, blockers, meeting conflicts): respond within 4 hours during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM)
    - For regular project messages: respond within 24 hours
    - For non-urgent messages: respond within 48 hours

* What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)
    Each teammate should notify in the groupchat if:
        - they can't make a deadline
        - they have to miss a team meeting or lecture
        - they're struggling with their assigned tasks and need help
        - they encounter technical issues that might delay their work
        - they have questions that need team input or decision
        - there are any changes to their availability or schedule

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)
    We expect the following respectful and inclusive behaviors:
        - Actively listen to each team member's ideas without interruption
        - Give everyone an equal opportunity to contribute and share their thoughts
        - Use inclusive language and avoid making assumptions about others' knowledge or abilities

    - For routine decisions (coding standards, meeting times, minor feature adjustments): majority vote (2 out of 3 team members)
    - For urgent decisions when not all members can be reached: team lead makes decision with input from available members, but decision must be ratified by full team within 24 hours
    - All decisions will be documented and shared with the team via group chat
    - If consensus cannot be reached, team will seek guidance from TAs or instructors

---
## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)
    - First step: Direct, respectful conversation between involved parties to understand each other's perspectives
    - Second step: If direct conversation doesn't resolve the issue, bring the matter to the full team for discussion

    - Throughout the process, maintain focus on the project goals and what's best for the team
    - Document any agreed-upon resolutions to prevent future misunderstandings
